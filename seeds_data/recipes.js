      "Creamy, cheesy and perfectly indulgent, scalloped potatoes are a classic for good reason. While cooking, the starch from the potatoes thickens the cream into a luscious sauce while the cheesy topping becomes golden and nutty in the oven. Allowing the casserole to rest for 10 minutes before serving makes it easier to slice.",
    ingredients:
      "2 tablespoons unsalted butter and plus more for the baking dish;4 medium russet potatoes (about 2 pounds);1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup whole milk;2 cloves garlic (minced);1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves;Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper;Pinch freshly grated nutmeg;1 cup shredded Gruyere (about 4 ounces);1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan (about 1 1/2 ounces)",
    directions:
      "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch square baking dish with unsalted butter.;Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1/8-inch-thick slices using a mandoline or sharp knife.;Add the sliced potatoes, heavy cream, whole milk, 2 tablespoons butter, garlic, thyme, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and the nutmeg to a medium saucepan.

(They should not be soft and falling apart.) Remove the saucepan from the heat.;Add the Gruyere and Parmesan, stirring gently to combine. Pour the potato mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake until the top is light golden brown and the potatoes are cooked through and tender, about 45 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.",

      "Yes, you can cook ribs in a slow cooker! In this easy recipe, the seasoning paste transforms into a savory dipping sauce. Slather it on the ribs and pop them on the grill just before serving for a final char.",
    ingredients:
      "One 6-ounce can tomato paste;1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar;1/4 cup apple cider vinegar;1 tablespoon chili powder;1 tablespoon ground mustard seeds;2 teaspoons granulated garlic;2 teaspoons smoked paprika;2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce;Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper;3 racks baby back ribs (about 3 pounds);Oil, for grilling",

Cut each rack of ribs in half and add to the slow cooker. Use your hands to rub the sauce on to the ribs. Cover with a lid and cook on low heat until tender, about 4 hours.;Gently transfer the ribs to a baking sheet and cool for at least 20 minutes. This will help maintain the shape of the ribs as they grill. Whisk the sauce at the bottom of the slow cooker until smooth. Reserve 1/4 cup of the sauce to brush on to the ribs and save any remaining sauce to serve on the side (it will thicken as it cools).;Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grates. Grill the ribs, top-side down, until lightly charred in parts, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, brush the top side of the ribs with the reserved barbecue sauce and grill until the underside of the ribs are lightly charred in parts, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a platter and serve immediately with the extra barbecue sauce on the side.;Alternatively, broil the ribs to char. Preheat the broiler with a rack set 4-inches from the heat source. Transfer the cooked ribs to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush the top of the ribs with the reserved sauce and broil top-side up, until browned and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.",
